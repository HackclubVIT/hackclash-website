# HackClash 2022

## Style guide
* Use four spaces, not tabs.
* Pretty-print your code before pushing it.
* Don't use inline styles.
* DONT USE BRs FOR NEWLINES - use `<p>` tags, make divs, or use CSS white-space: `pre`.
* If you're adding an asset or page then check if it's already there before adding it.
* For variable names, use kebab-case for CSS class and id names, and camelCase for JavaScript variable names.
